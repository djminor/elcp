    <p>Have you ever heard of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska?</p>
    <br>
    <p>If not, that's okay. I hadn't either until I met my wife. The reason for that is that only 25 people in the world speak the Nebraska Ponca language fluently.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I was on another language learning app one day a few weeks before Christmas, pondering that fact, and I realized that even the languages that I knew were endangered don't even come close to being as endangered as Ponca.</p>
    <br>
    <p>That day, I tracked down the most comprehensive Nebraska Ponca dictionary I could find and bought it for my wife. It only had 5,000 words, but when she opened it on Christmas day I saw her connect to that book in a way I had only seen a few times before.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Now, I speak English. My family has for hundreds of years. I won't ever know what exactly it's like to feel what she felt -- but I do know that it was a good feeling, and I want to bring that feeling to others.</p>
